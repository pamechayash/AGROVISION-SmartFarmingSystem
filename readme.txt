PROJECT OVERVIEW

This platform is a comprehensive solution designed to assist farmers in optimising their crop management practices. By leveraging inputs of nutrient levels (N, P, and K) in the soil, leaf images for disease detection, and live weather information, this system provides valuable recommendations for crop selection, fertiliser application, and disease prevention.

FEATURES->

1 DISEASE PREDICTION FROM IMAGES OF LEAFS FEATURE:

• The platform incorporates advanced image analysis techniques and deep learning algorithms to predict diseases from images of crop leaves.

• Farmers can capture images of affected leaves using a smartphone or a camera and upload them to the platform.

• The system analyzes the leaf images, extracting relevant features and patterns associated with different diseases. and predict which desease is affecting the plant
 *ALSO RECOMMENDS CAUSES , PREVENTION and CURES of diseases
 

 2. CROP RECOMMENDATION
 
• THE SYSTEM PROVIDES FARMERS WITH A LIST OF RECOMMENDED CROPS BASED ON N. P, AND K LEVELS IN THE SOIL.
• RECOMMENDATIONS CONSIDER CLIMATE, SEASONALITY, AND MARKET DEMAND.
• THE GOAL IS TO ASSIST FARMERS IN MAKING ECONOMICALLY VIABLE DECISIONS FOR CROP SELECTION.


3. FERTILISER RECOMMENDATIONS:

• The system suggests appropriate fertiliser formulations or blends to address nutrient deficiencies in the soil.
 * Recommendations consider the nutrient requirements of the recommended crops.
• Precise dosage guidelines are provided for optimal fertiliser application.

4. LIVE WEATHER INFORMATION:

-> THE PLATFORM INTEGRATES REAL-TIME WEATHER DATA TO PROVIDE FARMERS WITH UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, RAINFALL, AND WIND CONDITIONS.
-> FARMERS CAN ACCESS THIS INFORMATION WITHIN THE PLATFORM, ALLOWING THEM TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR CROP MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

5. USER FRIENDLY INTERFACE

• THE INTERFACE ALLOWS EASY INPUT OF SOIL NUTRIENT LEVELS.
• CROP AND FERTILISER RECOMMENDATIONS ARE DISPLAYED CLEARLY.

HOW TO RUN ->

1. clone project
2. move to flaskServer dir and install requirements using requirements.txt by command - "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. move to nodeServer dir and install node_modules using command "npm install" 
4. move to frontend dir and install node_modules using command "npm install"
